# UCLA-ECE-210A-Learning-and-Adaptation-Final

My files are large mainly because of the animations but this should be ok.

Best way to read my project is to download the HTML file and open it in an internet browser like Google Crome, press F11 for full screen, and view the animations as you please.

The paper_model.ipynb is the file that contains the project. The other notebook is the one that contains the Boids implemetation from Reynolds which is just interesting to compare the results to. I programmed that one first to get an idea of how I would program the project.

Anim 1 is a test.


Anim 2 is the simple MMSE estimate.

Anim 3 is MMSE with L2 regularizer with rho = 1/10.

Anim 4 is MMSE with L2 regularizer with rho = max eigenvalue of the covariance matrix.

Anim 5 is data fusion method 2, each node does its own processing and then uses its individual covariance matrices to get full estimate.

Anim 6 is using the geometry of the model (truth / best performing).

Anim 7 is used the diffusion gradient descent algorithm (SGD).

Anim 8 is same as 7 with faster moving targets and multiple targets.
